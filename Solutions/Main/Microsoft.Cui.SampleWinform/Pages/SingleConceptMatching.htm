        The SingleConceptMatching Control searches and encodes entered text as SNOMED&nbsp;CT&reg; codes. 
        The blue area above is what might be seen in an application. The areas above and below the blue areas 
        show possible contexts in which the control might appear, and the type of information which is output. To use 
        this sample, first set a context by selecting a scenario and the type of search to use.
        
        The Single Concept Matching Control is implemented by hosting and configuring the application code in a Microsoft Health CUI compliant manner.
        The sample application represents a set of features to promote quick understanding of the 
        Single Concept Matching control, demonstrate the ability to search for clinical concepts using user 
        initiated search and progressive search method, the ability to invoke a terminologies provider 
        to parse and identify clinical concepts in the additional text box. The control is designed to 
        be agnostic of the clinical information source</p>
