            The sample application provides a mechanism to view and compare items with duration,
            and single events, against time. It presents a set of features to promote quick
            understanding of the high level picture as well as the identification of causal-effect
            relationships and trends. This control could be used to convey information either
            to the patient or to the clinician.
        </p>

            The Timeline Control is implemented by hosting and configuring the application code
            in a Microsoft Health CUI compliant manner.</p>
