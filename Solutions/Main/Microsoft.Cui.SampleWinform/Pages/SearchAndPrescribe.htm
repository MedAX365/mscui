            The SearchAndPrescribe Control allows designers and developers to implement a set
            of prescribing functionality. The sample application, implemented alongside the
            Medications List View, represents a set of features to promote quick understanding
            of the Search and Prescribe control, including support for template prescriptions
            and prescribing rules for individual types of medications. The sample is implemented
            by hosting and configuring the application code in a Microsoft Health CUI compliant
            manner</p>
