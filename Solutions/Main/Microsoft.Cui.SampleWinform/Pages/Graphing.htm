        <p>
            The Graphing Control allows designers and developers to display data series as graphs in their applications.
            The Graphing Control is implemented by hosting and configuring the application code in a Microsoft Health CUI compliant manner.
            The sample application presents a set of features  to promote quick understanding and detailed interrogation of data, such as a focus line to reveal values across all graphed data, ability to remove, replace and reorder the stacked graphs (via the checkbox and drag and drop using the data selector - top left of the control), and the ability to show or hide data values.
            This control is designed to be data agnostic within the clinical data arena, but was developed in the context of the following vital signs  data sets: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature</li>
            <li>Pulse rate</li>
            <li>Respiratory rate</li>
            <li>Blood pressure</li>
            <li>Oxygen saturation</li>      
        </ul>
