        <p>
            Since November 2004, Microsoft has been working with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx"  title="Link to the National Health Service website (New Window)">
                National Health Service (NHS)</a> in England to help improve patient safety through
            the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cui.nhs.uk" title="Link to the NHS Common User Interface website (New Window)" > NHS Common
            User Interface (CUI) Programme</a>. As part of this, through extensive
            research with healthcare and I.T. professionals, Microsoft
            has been creating user interface Design Guidance and supporting Toolkit controls,
            with the intention of providing a common look and feel for NHS systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In June 2007, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Health Common User Interface Website.
            This provides a mechanism for publicly releasing the Design Guidance and Toolkit
            controls with the intention to:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obtain wider exposure for the guidance and controls</li>
                <li>Create a community for feedback and input into the ongoing development of the Design
                    Guidance</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, Microsoft Health CUI has provided regular releases of the Design Guidance
            and Toolkit controls in a format suitable for public use. As part of future envisioning,
            Microsoft Health CUI has published <a href="../Showcase/Demonstrators.aspx" title="Link to Demonstrators Showcase page">
                demonstrators</a> to explore how emerging and established technologies could
            be used for healthcare applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            To date, Microsoft has worked with numerous Independent Software Vendors, helping
            them to develop safer and consistent user interfaces, which successfully incorporate
            the needs of the healthcare industry.

            Patient Safety Principles
        </h2>
        <p>
            Patient safety is a top priority within the global healthcare industry and is paramount
            to all design and development of Microsoft Health CUI Design Guidance and Toolkit
            controls. This is assured through the use of a set of Patient Safety Principles,
            which are also of importance to organizations, such as the 
                World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA).

            Microsoft Health CUI is committed to helping healthcare providers improve patient
            safety and increase clinical productivity. This is achieved through a program
            of user research that includes a variety of structured activities involving clinicians,
            patient safety experts, and other potential end-users.

        <p>
            The development of the Microsoft Health CUI Design Guidance and Toolkit controls
            is an ongoing and iterative process that is devised to constantly improve patient
            safety. As such, regular updates to these will be made available through the Microsoft
            Health CUI Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all future releases, the controls will be developed in <a target="_blank" href="http://windowsclient.net/WPF/"
