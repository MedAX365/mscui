            Introduction to Microsoft Health CUI</h1>
        <p>
            To date, there has been no standardization for the display of important information
            elements, such as patient identification information and dates, in clinical applications.
            As healthcare becomes more reliant on electronic systems, there is a need to standardize
            display elements so that healthcare professionals can switch between different applications
            and rapidly identify the information they need, thereby increasing clinical effectiveness and improving patient safety.
