        <p>
            Since its launch in 2007, Microsoft Health CUI has been building an international
            network of organizations and individuals with expertise in clinical practice, patient
            safety and clinical applications. The collaboration between these advocates has
            allowed Microsoft Health CUI to focus on addressing the realities of practice and
            patient care, whilst focusing on patient safety.

            seven years. Always leading the adoption of new technologies and UI design ideas,
            their software was one of the first to use AJAX techniques (2001) and they invest
            heavily in mobile devices and Tablet PCs. Bluewire Technologies have always been
            led by healthcare professionals, who appreciate their fast and highly functional
            interfaces. Experienced clinicians are highly adept at thumbing through large volumes
            of disorganized paper case notes, and it was important to build on this. Bluewire
            Technologies succeeded in producing an interface, based on a familiar organizational
            structure, able to accommodate the full breadth of data contained in the notes.
            They combine best of breed technologies, including Tablet PCs and speech recognition
            to produce a product that leaves users feeling confident and comfortable. New users
            frequently respond to their interface with an instant 'Wow!'.</p>

            <i>"MedicMate is all about reducing oversights, generating efficiencies and improving
                communication, especially at handover in hospital. Therefore it is crucial that
                its clinical user interface aids users and eliminates misinterpretations. On meeting
                with the Microsoft Health CUI team, we discovered two things; 1. that Microsoft
                Health CUI spoke our language and had a very thorough set of sensible, usable design
                guidelines, but also 2. that, despite our best efforts, we had not got our clinical
                user interface perfect. By using the Microsoft Health CUI guidelines, we are working
                to put this right in v2.0, we only wish we had worked with the Microsoft Health
                CUI team in the development of v1.0"</i></p>

            MedicMate allows healthcare professionals to manage their patient workload efficiently
            and effectively from their mobile device. MedicMate helps users keep patients, wards,
            jobs, and problems, up-to-date with quick entry methods. Healthcare professionals
            can handover wirelessly, keep protocols and guidelines in their workflow, maintain
            telephone and bleep numbers therefore no longer needing to wait for Switchboard,
            manage to-do lists, print paper lists (neatly), and set alarms, all on an encrypted
            database. Essential for wards, for clinics, and for on-calls. MedicMate, carefully
            designed by doctors and nurses who understand the problems and issues confronting
            frontline personnel on the wards, offers a unique solution to look after the healthcare
            professional.</p>

            as a leading centre for health informatics and software solutions. Pushing both
            the technical and human boundaries of implementing active decision support, SCHIN's
            Medication Review software is unique, indeed revolutionary, in its capacity to extract
            and screen information from medical records, flag up dangerous drug interactions
            and integrate healthcare systems, all to externally accredited standards of data

            innovative technological systems that provide measurable benefits to the hospitals
            which employ them. From handheld software, which allows for bedside collection of
            vital signs data, to online learning modules, to plans for software which will support
            the implementation of consultant contracts - all projects are united by being practical
            implementations of research on patient care and outcomes.
