            A clear, consistent and simple interface enables healthcare workers to perform their
            jobs more efficiently by being able to find, view and enter patient information
            in a predictable and easily recognizable manner. This also aids in the reduction
            of their cognitive load and the need for specialist training.

            Detailed information is provided in the Microsoft Health CUI Design Guidance to
            ensure correct implementation. These can be incorporated into the ISVs design specifications,
            and, if required, extended to suit further requirements. This also helps to reduce
            human, time and financial utilization during the Design phase. The Design Guidance
            is platform independent and meets Best
            Practices within the healthcare industry.

            Toolkit controls are provided that conform to the Microsoft Health CUI Design Guidance.
            These can be incorporated into the clinical application, or the source code can
            be extended to suit further requirements. This ensures correct implementation and
            aids in the reduction of human, time and financial utilization during the Development
            phase. The Toolkit controls use the latest Microsoft technologies and meet Best
            Practices within the healthcare industry, therefore reducing incompatibility issues
            with third-party healthcare systems.
