            This guide contains all the Medication Line 
            design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) 
            accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of the guidance that are new to you.

            Remember that this guide is not a replacement for the definitive version which 
            includes further usage examples (showing both correct and incorrect application) 
            and details the rationale behind the guidance.

            <h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>
            <p>
            Medications may be represented electronically in varying degrees of detail 
            as well as in different areas of a user interface. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                A prescription summary displayed as part of a 
                patient summary
                </li>
                <li>
                A subset of prescription detail displayed in 
                a list of patient&#39;s current medications
                </li>
                <li>
                A different subset of prescription detail 
                displayed in an electronic drug administration schedule
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            A text description of a medication appearing in such views is 
            referred to in this guidance as a &#39;medication line&#39;. This 
            guidance details the content, formatting and layout of medication 
            lines depending on the purpose of the clinical application area 
            in which they appear.
            </p>
