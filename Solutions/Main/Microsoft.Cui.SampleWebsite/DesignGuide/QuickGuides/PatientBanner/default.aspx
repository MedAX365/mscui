            This guide contains all design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of guidance that are new to you.

            Remember that this guide is not a replacement for the definitive version which

            and details the rationale behind the guidance.

            <h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>
            <p>
            The term &#39;patient banner&#39; refers to the area of the clinical application&#39;s user interface that 
            contains patient identification information used to match records with patients or any of their 
            associated artefacts, such as samples, letters, specimens, wristbands and X-rays.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although there are no accurate figures 
            on the frequency or cost of mismatching errors, they form a significant part of the whole range 
            of errors in healthcare. A clear and prominent indicator of which patient record is currently 
            in view, using the core patient identifiers, is an important component in reducing errors of failed 
            or mismatched patient identification.
