            This guide contains all the Patient Name Input and Display 
            design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) 
            accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of the guidance that are new to you.

            Remember that this guide is not a replacement for the definitive version which 
            includes further usage examples (showing both correct and incorrect application) 
            and details the rationale behind the guidance.

            <h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>
            <p>
            This guidance specifies a user interface for the input and display of patient names. 
            Currently, within a given clinical context, patient names are displayed in a variety of 
            formats. Confusion over a patient&#39;s name is likely to lead to delays in identification 
            or cause misidentification of patients and items associated with them (such as records and 
            letters).
