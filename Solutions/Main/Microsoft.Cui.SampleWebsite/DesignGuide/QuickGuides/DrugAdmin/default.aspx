            The guide contains all of those design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) 
            accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of guidance that are new to you.
            </p>

            However, remember that the full and definitive versions of the Design Guides are 
            found at

            further usage examples (showing both correct and incorrect application) and detail 
            the rationale behind the guidance.
