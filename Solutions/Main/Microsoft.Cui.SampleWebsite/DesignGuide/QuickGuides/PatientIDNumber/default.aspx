            This guide contains all the Patient Identification Number Input and Display 
            design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) 
            accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of the guidance that are new to you.

            Remember that this guide is not a replacement for the definitive version which 
            includes further usage examples (showing both correct and incorrect application) 
            and details the rationale behind the guidance.

            <h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>
            <p>
            The patient identification number is a unique identifier that makes it possible to 
            share patient information across the clinical organization safely, efficiently and 
            accurately. Unambiguous display enhances patient safety and application usability by 
            enabling rapid correlation with paper records and forms.
            </p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong> This guide contains some examples explicitly 
            derived from research in the UK. Whilst you should adhere to the underlying principles, 
            disregard any country-specific detail if it is not appropriate for your locale. 
            Ensure that your clinical application adheres to the requirements of the location 
            where it will be used.</p>
