            This guide contains all the Telephone Number Input and Display 
            design guidelines (mandatory and recommended) 
            accompanied by example diagrams to illustrate their application. Although offered 
            as a quick reference to already familiar guidance, you may also find this guide 
            useful for exploring areas of the guidance that are new to you.

            Remember that this guide is not a replacement for the definitive version which 
            includes further usage examples (showing both correct and incorrect application) 
            and details the rationale behind the guidance.

            <h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>
            <p>
            This guidance specifies a user interface for the input and display of telephone 
            numbers. Telephone numbers are essential for enabling communication both within 
            and outside the clinical organization and therefore it is important that they 
            can be read and entered accurately, and are not mistaken 
            for other numbers such as the patient identification number.
            </p>

            <strong>Note</strong>
            This guide contains some examples explicitly derived from research in the UK. 
            Whilst you should adhere to the underlying principles, disregard any 
            <span class="nowrap">country-specific</span> detail if it is not appropriate for 
            your locale. Ensure that your clinical application adheres to the requirements of 
            the location where it will be used.
